# brunch-with-ember-reloaded
A new and up-to-date [Brunch](http://brunch.io) skeleton for developing [Ember](http://emberjs.com) applications based on the official Ember [Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/master.zip).

## Demo
I built a demo app using this skeleton, based on the [Building an App with Ember.js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga99hMi7wfY) video by [Tom Dale](http://twitter.com/tomdale).

**Demo**: [ember-bloggr](http://dev.gcollazo.com/ember-bloggr)
**Source**: [https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-bloggr](https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-bloggr)

## Versions
- [Ember v1.0.0-rc.6](http://emberjs.com)
- [Handlebars 1.0.0-rc.4](http://handlebarsjs.com)
- [jQuery v1.9.1](http://jquery.com)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate v4.2.0](http://html5boilerplate.com)

## Features
- **CoffeeScript** - a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
- **Stylus** - Expressive, dynamic, robust CSS pre-processor.
- **auto-reload-brunch** - Adds automatic browser reloading support to brunch.
- **uglify-js-brunch** - Adds UglifyJS support to brunch.

## Getting started

```
brunch new <appname> --skeleton git@github.com:gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded.git
cd <appname>
brunch watch -s
```
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) on your browser.

### Ember Data
There's a little cake task to download the Ember Data from [builds.emberjs.com](http://builds.emberjs.com) and copy it to your `vendor/scripts` directory.

```
cake getemberdata
```
When the script finishes just add `'vendor/scripts/ember-data-latest.js'` to your `config.coffee` file just under `'vendor/scripts/ember-*.js'`.

### Generators
This skeleton makes use of [scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme) generators to help you create common files quicker. To use first install skaffolt globally with `npm install -g scaffolt`. Then you can use the following command to generate files.

```
skaffolt model <name> 				→ app/models/			Name.coffee
skaffolt view <name>				→ app/views/			NameView.coffee
skaffolt controller <name> 			→ app/controllers/	NameController.coffee
skaffolt arraycontroller <name>		→ app/controllers/	NamesController.coffee
skaffolt route <name> 				→ app/routes/			NameRoute.coffee
skaffolt template <name> 			→ app/templates		name.hbs
```
There's a few more commands you can use with scaffolt and also instruction on how to create your own generators, so make sure you check out the [docs](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme).

### Testing
You can write your tests in the `test` folder, just make sure they are named `*_test.coffee`. You can customize the test to user PhantomJS, Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Opera on the `test/karma.conf.js` file. There's a lot of other settings there as well. Run tests with:

```
cake test
```
